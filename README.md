# Check if Tree is Balanced 🧠🌳

This project checks whether a given binary tree is height-balanced or not. It includes both a C++ implementation for console-based checking and a simple web-based UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for better interactivity.

## 📌 What Does It Do?

- Accepts binary tree input in **preorder** format (using `-1` for NULL nodes)
- Recursively constructs the tree
- Checks if the tree is height-balanced
- Displays the result either in:
  - C++ Console
  - Web Interface (via browser)

## 💡 Concepts Used

- **Recursion**
- **Binary Tree Construction**
- **Height Calculation**
- **Balance Checking**
- **Frontend Logic Integration**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C++** – Core logic for checking balance
- **HTML/CSS** – Basic UI layout and styling
- **JavaScript** – Tree input processing and logic in browser

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 👉 For C++ (Console Version)

1. Open your terminal or any C++ IDE (like CodeBlocks or VS Code)
2. Compile and run the `main.cpp` file
3. Enter tree input in **preorder**, use `-1` for NULL nodes
4. Example Input:
